# Assignment 1 Essay

## Motivation for Learning Supercomputing

I’m extremely interested in expanding my knowledge within the data science field. With supercomputing, I can delve into more complex and comprehensive systems for processing such problems that are difficult to solve with a conventional computer. As with previous, more introductory courses, we have focused on small datasets. I anticipate learning how supercomputing works in intertwining massive datasets and real-life settings.

My goal with this course is to be more confident with my skills in an upper-level course and demonstrate true dedication to the science. I hope to learn extensively about how data science is applied in real life and further find out the true importance of what I am studying. More personally, I’d love to see possible new research ideas come about from this course for me to be passionate about—I reach to grow beyond my courses, but struggle to find something I am extremely passionate enough for.

## Plan of Attack for the Semester

My plan of attack for learning this semester will be to stay consistent with lessons and ensure I am understanding beyond the assignments. This will include making sure to ask questions and for help when need be. In addition, making sure I don’t simply memorize all at once but practice repetition. This includes using the terminal daily, revisiting lessons and assignments, and rebuilding or rerunning codes until I can understand structures.

In previous courses, I had the “concept” portions down, but not the “application” portions, so I intend to fix that gap through studying techniques focused on repetition and practice.

## Folder Structure and Reproducibility

The folder structure I created is similar in design to the given example for the reason that it is direct and simple. It separates data, code, and results. The raw data is untouched and stored separately for preservation purposes, creating a clear distinction from processed data.

Code is separate for reproducibility reasons, as are results, which are treated as disposable. The workflow is thus easy to understand and reproduce.

## Importance of Documented Code

I find documented code in computational research to be essential, as it is a way of communicating. Even if the code is correct, it can be useless if it is not able to be understood. If no one knows how it works or in what way it is being used, it fails to communicate its worth.

Proper documentation allows for collaboration and long-term usage. READMEs are crucial for this reason—transparency and continuity.

## Background and Interests

My personal background includes some basic to intermediate programming and data analysis skills. I still want to develop more confidence in both and be able to see such skills used in real-life settings.

I was unaware of supercomputing before this course, but after some research, it is an extremely interesting topic that I see as a true opportunity to strengthen the foundation needed for both academic research and industrial reasons. My true goal for now is to learn more about how I can delve into data science research with whatever I come out of with supercomputing, whether assisted or independent, to further push my knowledge past the textbooks. I look forward to learning, making noticeable growth, and finding solutions.
